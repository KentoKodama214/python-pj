  These CSV files are encoded in UTF-8 and all of them have the following columns:

	LocID (numeric): numeric code for the location; for countries and areas, it follows the ISO 3166-1 numeric standard
	Location (string): name of the region, subregion, country or area
	VarID (numeric): numeric code for the variant
	Variant (string): projection variant name (Medium is the most used); for more information see Definition of projection variants
	Time (string): label identifying the single year (e.g. 1950) or the period of the data (e.g. 1950-1955)
	MidPeriod (numeric): numeric value identifying the mid period of the data, with the decimal representing the month (e.g. 1950.5 for July 1950)

https://population.un.org/wpp/Download/Files/1_Indicators%20(Standard)/CSV_FILES/WPP2019_Life_Table_OtherVariants.csv
  Life Table. Abridged life tables up to age 100 by sex and both sexes combined providing a set of values showing the mortality experience of a hypothetical group of infants born at the same time and subject throughout their lifetime to the specific mortality rates of a given period, from 1950-1955 to 2095-2100.
	mx: Central death rate, nmx, for the age interval (x, x+n)
	qx: Probability of dying (nqx), for an individual between age x and x+n
	px: Probability of surviving, (npx), for an individual of age x to age x+n
	lx: Number of survivors, (lx), at age (x) for 100000 births
	dx: Number of deaths, (ndx), between ages x and x+n
	Lx: Number of person-years lived, (nLx), between ages x and x+n
	Sx: Survival ratio (nSx) corresponding to proportion of the life table population in age group (x, x+n) who are alive n year later
	Tx: Person-years lived, (Tx), above age x
	ex: Expectation of life (ex) at age x, i.e., average number of years lived subsequent to age x by those reaching age x
	ax: Average number of years lived (nax) between ages x and x+n by those dying in the interval
